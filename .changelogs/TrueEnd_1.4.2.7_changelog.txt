**FABRIC PORT IS ON ITS WAY!** (Accidental ToS violation, oops)

## Removed
- Removed SleepPopup random event
  - We just realized it's against Modrinth's and CurseForge's ToS, oops
- Removed Herobrine

## Bug Fixes & Technical Improvements
- Improved and optimized AlphaFoodSystem
  - Less mess of a code
  - Works with modded food items (aka blocks them)
  - Fixed a bug where you'd be able to avoid the whole thing with offhand

## Known Bugs
- Some ChatReplies such as `sing`* and `28/09/1939`* after version 47.4.4/5 of Forge
  - Just so we're clear, `28/09/1939` is the date the song "We'll Meet Again" came out
- Credits music plays server-side, making it so everyone around can hear it
- On multiplayer, player isn't frozen when on credits screen making them attackable by mobs
- NoCooldown in BTD making attacks with Better Combat hilariously fast
